1. TREATAS() --> This will return a filter tanle. E.g.:

VAR __DS0FilterTable=
TREATAS(
    {
        "CBRE - Yorkshire Water",
        "CBRE - Yorkshire Water - Auto"
    },
    'Dim Client'[Client Name]
)

The variale (VAR) DS0 (dataset (Semantic model I think? Could be wrong...) used index 0 (no.1)) FilterTable is just a label. None of it is defined syntax, and will appear when power BI auto-generates a clump of DAX from a built visual. 
In this example, it will return the column Client Name from the table Dim Client, filtered to just contain those 2 possible values. the text betwen the {} is known as a string literal.
